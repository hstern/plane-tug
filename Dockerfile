# Multi-stage build for plane-tug.
#
# Layout:
#   - `build`   compiles the static binary
#   - `test`    inherits the built layers and runs vet / race / govulncheck
#   - `runtime` distroless, copies only the binary
#
# CI builds the `test` target before publishing the runtime image; a
# failing test stage prevents a push. Layer ordering (go.mod first, then
# the rest of the source) keeps dependency download cached across
# source-only changes.
